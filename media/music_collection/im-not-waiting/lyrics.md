# Im Not Waiting

[Verse]
World keeps turning
I see
And I'm still learning
Are you
Or not?

[Prechorus]
Ticking clock
Says a lot

[Chorus]
I'm not waiting
No more
I'm just hating
This door

[Verse 2]
Don't know where to go
Next time
Don't know what to show
I find
It's all fake

[Chorus]
I'm not waiting
No more
I'm just hating
This door

[Bridge]
Is it me or is it you
That is true
Is it me or is it you
Feeling blue
