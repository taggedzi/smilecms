Welcome to SmileCMS! This is the very first entry rendered by the pipeline, and it
shows how markdown content, inline media, and audio all come together in the
static site.

Take a look at one of the studies we recently finished:

[Play Doorway Dreams](audio:audio/doorway-dreams/doorway-dreams.mp3)

With this workflow each article can travel with its own media and be published
as a fully static document.
